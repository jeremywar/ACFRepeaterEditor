Use with ACF repeater plugin for easier page editing. This plugin adds an accordion feature to the page edit view.

== Description ==

## What this plugin is:
This plugin is designed for use when using the Advanced Custom Fields Plugin - Repeater add on.

If you are using the repeater plugin add on you will probably notice that the paged view becomes quite cumbersome as you add more entires using the repeater fields. It becomes very difficult to drag fields up or down and the page becomes very long.

This plugin is the answer to make editing easier.


## What this plugin is not:
This plugin is not intended to create accordion functionality for custom fields on the website. It is only meant to make the page edit view easier to work with.

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
